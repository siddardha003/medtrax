# Authentication Role Debugging Guide

## Issue: User Login Redirecting to Hospital Dashboard

### Problem Description
Regular users were being incorrectly redirected to /hospital-dashboard after login instead of staying on the homepage.

### Root Causes
1. Role determination logic was inconsistent across components
2. The login action wasn't explicitly setting the role for regular users
3. The isAdmin flag wasn't being set properly in some cases

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Role Assignment in Redux Action
- Modified the `loginAccount` action to set `isAdmin` more explicitly
- Added extra console logging to track navigation decisions
- Made sure regular users are explicitly assigned the 'user' role

### 2. Enhanced Login Component Updates
- Modified `EnhancedLogin.js` to explicitly set role='user' for regular users
- Added console logging to better track login attempts

## Testing Authentication Flows

### Testing Regular User Login
1. Use the User Login tab in the login form
2. Enter credentials for a regular user
3. After login, you should:
   - Stay on the homepage (/)
   - See your profile icon in the header
   - Have the role set to 'user' in Redux state

### Testing Admin Login
1. Use the Admin Login tab in the login form
2. Select the appropriate admin role
3. Enter admin credentials
4. After login, you should be redirected to the corresponding dashboard:
   - super_admin → /admin-panel
   - hospital_admin → /hospital-dashboard
   - shop_admin → /shop-dashboard

## Common Issues & Solutions

### User Gets Redirected to Wrong Dashboard
- Check console logs to see what role is being assigned
- Verify the role in the Redux state matches what you expect
- Look for any competing navigation logic in components

### isAdmin Flag Not Working
- Make sure it's being properly set in the Redux action
- Confirm it's properly checked in the Header component
- Verify the Dashboard component is using it correctly

## Verifying Role Assignment

To verify roles are working properly:
1. Log in with different user types
2. Use Redux DevTools to inspect the user state:
   - Check `userInfo.role` is set correctly
   - Verify `userInfo.isAdmin` boolean matches the role

## Backend Integration

If problems persist, check:
1. The role field in the response from the login API
2. How roles are stored in the database
3. The authentication middleware on protected routes
