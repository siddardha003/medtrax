# SEPARATE LOGIN FLOWS FOR USERS AND ADMINS

## Overview

The login system has been completely separated for regular users and administrators to prevent any cross-navigation between these distinct flows. This document explains the changes made and how the login flow now works.

## Key Changes

1. **Completely Separated Login Components**
   - `UserLogin.js` - Used exclusively for regular users
   - `AdminLogin.js` - Used exclusively for admin users (super_admin, hospital_admin, shop_admin)
   - Removed cross-linking buttons between these components

2. **Dedicated Redux Actions**
   - `loginUserAccount` - Used only for regular user logins, always redirects to Homepage
   - `loginAdminAccount` - Used only for admin logins, redirects to appropriate dashboard based on role

3. **Role-Based Navigation**
   - Regular users always go to Homepage after login
   - Admins go to their specific dashboard based on role:
     - super_admin → /admin-panel
     - hospital_admin → /hospital-dashboard 
     - shop_admin → /shop-dashboard

## Login Flow

### Regular Users
1. User visits `/login`
2. Enters email and password
3. Frontend calls `loginUserAccount` action
4. Upon successful login, user is redirected to Homepage (/)
5. Role is explicitly set to 'user'
6. isAdmin flag is forced to false

### Admin Users
1. Admin visits `/admin-login`
2. Enters email, password, and selects admin role
3. Frontend calls `loginAdminAccount` action
4. Role selection is required and validated
5. Upon successful login, admin is redirected to the appropriate dashboard
6. isAdmin flag is forced to true

## Authentication Logic

- Regular users cannot access admin dashboards
- Admins are directed to the appropriate dashboard based on their role
- There is no longer any navigation between user and admin login pages

## Security Considerations

1. The complete separation of login flows enhances security by preventing regular users from accessing admin features
2. Role validation happens both on the frontend and backend
3. Centralized navigation logic in Redux actions prevents any conflicting redirect logic
