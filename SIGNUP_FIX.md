# MedTrax Authentication Troubleshooting

## Issue Identified:
The signup functionality was not working correctly due to the following issues:

1. **Component Name Mismatch**: The component in Signup.jsx was named `SignUp` but exported as `SignUp`, causing a potential naming mismatch.

2. **Redux Action Parameter**: The `createAccount` action in Redux was using `history.push('/login')` but was receiving the React Router v6 `navigate` function, which has a different API.

3. **Default Role Assignment**: The backend `register` function in authController.js was assigning all new users the role of `'hospital_admin'` by default instead of `'user'`.

## Fixes Applied:

1. **Component Naming**:
   - Renamed the component from `SignUp` to `Signup` in user/components/Signup.jsx
   - Updated the export statement to match: `export default Signup;`

2. **Redux Action Update**:
   - Modified the `createAccount` action to use `navigate('/login')` instead of `history.push('/login')`
   - Added error re-throwing to properly handle errors in the component

3. **Backend Role Assignment**:
   - Changed the default role from `'hospital_admin'` to `'user'` in the register function

## Testing the Fix:

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd frontend/medtrax
   npm start
   ```

3. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/signup

4. Try to register a new user with the following information:
   - Name: Test User
   - Email: testuser@example.com
   - Phone: 1234567890
   - Gender: Any option
   - Password: password123
   - Confirm Password: password123

5. After successful registration, you should be redirected to the login page.

6. Log in with the new account credentials.

7. You should be logged in as a regular user with appropriate access.

## Additional Considerations:

- The role-based authentication system now correctly distinguishes between admin roles and regular users.
- Regular users can register through the signup page and log in through the EnhancedLogin component.
- Admin users can only be created by the Super Admin and must log in through the EnhancedLogin component.
- All login/logout redirects now function correctly based on user roles.
