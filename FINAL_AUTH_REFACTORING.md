# MedTrax Authentication and Navigation Refactoring

## Overview
This refactoring simplifies the authentication and navigation flow in MedTrax, ensuring that regular users remain on the main Homepage.jsx after login while admins are properly directed to their respective dashboards.

## Key Changes Made

1. **Fixed eslint error in Dashboard.js**
   - Removed stray `~` character after `default:` that was causing the error

2. **Updated Redux login action (actions.js)**
   - Modified to redirect regular users to homepage (`/`) instead of `/user-home`
   - Maintained admin redirection logic to role-specific dashboards

3. **Updated Header.jsx component**
   - Changed navigation logic to direct regular users to homepage
   - Maintained proper dropdown menu functionality

4. **Updated App.js routing**
   - Adjusted `/user-home` route to render Homepage.jsx instead of UserHome.jsx
   - This provides backward compatibility with any code still using `/user-home` paths

5. **Updated documentation**
   - AUTH_STRUCTURE.md updated to reflect the new flow
   - AUTH_TESTING.md updated with proper testing steps
   - Created NAVIGATION_UPDATE.md with explanation of changes

## Benefits

1. **Simplified User Experience**
   - Regular users no longer navigate away from the main homepage after login
   - Consistent experience with profile icon in header

2. **Clear Role Separation**
   - Regular users stay on Homepage.jsx
   - Admin users get directed to their specialized dashboards

3. **Reduced Component Redundancy**
   - Eliminated unnecessary use of Dashboard.js for regular users
   - Removed dependency on UserHome.jsx

## Final QA Steps

1. **Test User Login Flow**
   - Login as regular user and verify you stay on homepage
   - Check profile icon and dropdown functionality
   - Verify navigation through various site pages maintains login state

2. **Test Admin Login Flow**
   - Login as different admin types and verify proper dashboard redirection
   - Check profile icon and dropdown functionality
   - Verify dashboard-specific features work correctly

3. **Test Logout Flow**
   - Verify clean logout for both user and admin accounts
   - Check proper state reset and UI updates after logout

4. **Test Route Protection**
   - Verify admins cannot access other admin dashboards
   - Verify regular users cannot access admin dashboards
   - Verify unauthenticated users are redirected to login when accessing protected routes

## Code Cleanup Notes
- The UserHome.jsx component is no longer used but kept for reference
- Dashboard.js is primarily used for admin redirection logic and as a fallback
