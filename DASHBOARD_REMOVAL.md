# Dashboard Component Removal

## Summary
The Dashboard folder and its components have been removed from the application to simplify the navigation flow. This change is part of the effort to use the existing Homepage.jsx component as the main interface for regular users after login, rather than introducing unnecessary complexity with additional dashboard components.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed Dashboard Folder**
   - Deleted the entire Dashboard folder (`C:\Users\saray\Documents\medtrax\frontend\medtrax\src\components\Dashboard`)
   - This eliminates the legacy Dashboard.js component that was causing confusion in the navigation flow

2. **Updated App.js**
   - Removed the Dashboard import
   - Removed the `/dashboard` route
   - Kept only the necessary role-specific admin dashboard routes

3. **Updated Header.jsx**
   - Modified the `navigateToDashboard` function to redirect unknown admin roles to the homepage (`/`)
   - Regular users continue to be directed to the homepage

4. **Updated Redux actions.js**
   - Changed the fallback navigation for unknown admin roles to go to the homepage (`/`) instead of `/dashboard`

## Navigation Flow After Changes

### Regular Users
- Login → Remain on Homepage.jsx
- Click on profile icon → Navigate to Homepage.jsx

### Admin Users
- Super Admin: Login → Navigate to `/admin-panel`
- Hospital Admin: Login → Navigate to `/hospital-dashboard`
- Shop Admin: Login → Navigate to `/shop-dashboard`
- Unknown Admin Role: Login → Navigate to the homepage (`/`)

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**
   - Removed unnecessary components and routes
   - Reduced potential for confusion in the navigation flow

2. **Consistent User Experience**
   - Regular users stay on the main website (Homepage.jsx) after login
   - Admin users get their specialized interfaces

3. **Reduced Code Complexity**
   - Eliminated redundant components
   - Streamlined navigation logic

## Testing Instructions

1. **Regular User Login**
   - Login with regular user credentials
   - Verify you remain on the homepage
   - Try navigating to `/dashboard` (should now return 404)

2. **Admin User Login**
   - Login with admin credentials (hospital_admin, shop_admin, super_admin)
   - Verify redirection to the appropriate dashboard
   - Try navigating to `/dashboard` (should now return 404)
