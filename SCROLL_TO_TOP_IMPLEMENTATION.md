# Scroll to Top Implementation

## Problem
When navigating between pages using NavLink or Link components, the new page would open at the same scroll position as the previous page instead of starting from the top.

## Solution
Created a `ScrollToTop` component that automatically scrolls to the top whenever the route changes.

## Implementation Details

### 1. ScrollToTop Component (`frontend/medtrax/src/user/components/ScrollToTop.jsx`)
- Uses `useLocation` hook to detect route changes
- Automatically scrolls to top (0, 0) when pathname changes
- Uses smooth scrolling for better user experience
- Includes multiple scroll attempts to handle different loading scenarios:
  - Immediate scroll when route changes
  - Additional scroll after 100ms for content still loading
  - Final scroll after 500ms to ensure it works with fully loaded content

### 2. Integration in App.js
- Imported and added `ScrollToTop` component to the main App component
- Positioned it at the top level so it works for all routes

### 3. Features
- **Automatic**: No manual intervention required
- **Smooth**: Uses smooth scrolling behavior
- **Robust**: Multiple scroll attempts to handle edge cases
- **Clean**: Component doesn't render anything visible
- **Efficient**: Proper cleanup of timeouts

## How It Works
1. User clicks on any navigation link (NavLink, Link)
2. Route changes and `useLocation` detects the new pathname
3. `ScrollToTop` component's `useEffect` triggers
4. Component scrolls window to top (0, 0) with smooth behavior
5. Additional scroll attempts ensure it works even if content is still loading

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Navigate to any page and scroll down
2. Click on any navigation link in the header
3. Verify that the new page opens at the top
4. Test with different pages and scroll positions

## Files Modified
- `frontend/medtrax/src/user/components/ScrollToTop.jsx` (new file)
- `frontend/medtrax/src/App.js` (added import and component)

## Benefits
- Improved user experience
- Consistent page navigation behavior
- No need to manually scroll to top on each page
- Works with all existing navigation links automatically
