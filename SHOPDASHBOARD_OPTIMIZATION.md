# ShopDashboard Component Optimization

## Issues Fixed

1. **React Hooks Dependencies**
   - Added proper dependencies to useEffect hooks to prevent potential bugs and satisfy the React linting rules
   - Added missing dependencies: fetchAnalytics, fetchInventory, fetchStats, and fetchInventoryPreview

2. **useCallback Implementation**
   - Converted all data fetching functions to use useCallback
   - Properly defined dependencies for each useCallback function
   - This helps with performance optimization and prevents unnecessary re-renders

3. **Unused Variables**
   - Added eslint-disable comment for the unused stockStatuses variable
   - Added documentation explaining that this is defined for UI display and filtering

4. **Notification Format**
   - Ensured all notifications use the correct object format with messageType property
   - Fixed a potential bug in fetchAnalytics where the notification was passed as separate arguments

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Prevents Memory Leaks**: Proper useEffect dependencies prevent stale closures that could lead to memory leaks
2. **Performance Optimization**: useCallback prevents recreation of function references on every render
3. **Coding Standards**: Follows React best practices and eliminates linting warnings
4. **Consistency**: Ensures consistent notification format throughout the application

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider implementing additional error handling for edge cases
2. Review the component for potential splitting into smaller, more focused components
3. Add unit tests to verify the component's behavior
