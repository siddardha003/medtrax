# Runtime Error Debugging Guide: "Element type is invalid..."

## Problem
The runtime error "Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object" typically occurs when:

1. There's confusion between default and named exports/imports
2. A component isn't properly exported
3. There are circular imports
4. The path to the imported component is incorrect

## Solution Applied

1. **Fixed Signup Component Export**
   - Ensured `Signup.jsx` has a proper default export

2. **Updated Import in App.js**
   - Added explicit file extension in the import statement:
   ```js
   import Signup from './user/components/Signup.jsx';
   ```

3. **Renamed HospitalDashboardSimple Component**
   - Renamed the component to avoid naming conflicts with HospitalDashboard.js
   - Updated both the component name and export statement

## Testing Checklist

1. Verify user signup works without errors
2. Verify user login works without errors
3. Verify admin login (all roles) works without errors
4. Verify appropriate dashboard pages load after login based on user role
5. Verify hospital dashboard functions correctly
6. Verify hospital dashboard simple version works if needed

## Common Causes of This Error

1. **Missing or Incorrect Exports**: Make sure components have proper exports (default or named)
2. **Import Path Issues**: Double-check import paths, including file extensions for non-JS files
3. **Circular Dependencies**: Avoid circular import references between files
4. **Case Sensitivity**: Ensure file name casing matches import statements (especially important in case-sensitive file systems)
5. **Duplicate Component Names**: Avoid having multiple components with the same name

## Prevention Tips

1. Use consistent export/import patterns across your codebase
2. For components, prefer default exports with the same name as the file
3. Be explicit with file extensions for non-standard JavaScript files (.jsx, .ts, .tsx)
4. Use proper IDE tools that can detect import issues early
