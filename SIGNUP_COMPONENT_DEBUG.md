# MedTrax Signup Component Debug

## Issue Fixed
There was an issue with the Signup component in the MedTrax application. The error message indicated: "Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object."

## Root Causes
1. **Component Declaration Style**: Changed the component declaration from arrow function style (`const Signup = () => {}`) to regular function style (`function Signup() {}`), which is sometimes more resilient to certain types of imports.

2. **Import/Export Consistency**: Ensured the component name was consistent throughout the codebase - using `Signup` instead of a mix of `SignUp` and `Signup`.

3. **App.js Import Statement**: Cleaned up the App.js import statements to remove any confusing comments and ensure clean imports.

## Changes Made
1. Updated `frontend/medtrax/src/user/components/Signup.jsx`:
   - Changed component declaration to `function Signup() {}`
   - Kept export as `export default Signup;`

2. Cleaned up `App.js`:
   - Removed unnecessary comments from imports
   - Ensured correct spacing in route declarations

## Testing
To test the signup functionality:

1. Start the application:
   ```
   cd frontend/medtrax
   npm start
   ```

2. Navigate to the signup page:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/signup
   ```

3. Fill out the form with valid information and submit
   - Full Name: Test User
   - Email: testuser@example.com
   - Phone: 1234567890
   - Gender: Any option
   - Password: password123
   - Confirm Password: password123

4. You should be redirected to the login page after successful registration

## Additional Notes
- If issues persist, check the browser console for more specific error messages
- The "role" for newly registered users is now correctly set to 'user' in the backend
- Remember that only Super Admin can create admin accounts; regular signup is for users only
